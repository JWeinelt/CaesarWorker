# üèõÔ∏è CaesarWorker

[![Build](https://github.com/JWeinelt/CaesarWorker/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JWeinelt/CaesarWorker/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This is the official Repository for the **Caesar-Worker.**

## üõ´ What does this application do?
This application handles operations the panel can't do due to some limitations of Godot 3.5. That contains:
- üì• Managing downloads (updates for the worker, panel and other components)
- üèõÔ∏è Handling application processes
- üîî Sending OS-specific notifications

> [!WARNING]
> This application won't work standalone. Download a full release file [here](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/releases).

## ‚ù§Ô∏è These amazing people make Caesar big!
